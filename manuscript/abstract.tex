\title{A \proglang{R} package for rank-based test for clustered data: 
\pkg{clusrank}}
\author{Yujing Jiang, Jun Yan}
\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	Rank based tests are popular alternatives to 1-sample and 2-sample t-tests 
	when the distribution of the populations being compared are non-normal or 
	unknown. Corresponding functions for standard rank-based tests assuming 
	independence are available in \proglang{R} \pkg{base} package. However,  
	the assumption of
	independence is violated when there is clustering in the data. Recently, 
	several rank-based tests for clustered data have been proposed with 
	respective strengths for clustering with different natures. However, we are 
	unaware of any existing \proglang{R} package that provides functions 
	implementing the 
	available rank-based tests for clustered data and this motivated our 
	development of package \pkg{clusrank}. In this talk we are going to 
	introduce the 
	functions available in package \pkg{clusrank} and there usage.
